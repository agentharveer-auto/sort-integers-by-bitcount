Sort Integers by Bit Count
===========================

This repository provides a small, open-source solution to the LeetCode-style challenge: sort an array of non-negative integers by the number of 1s in their binary representation (ascending), breaking ties by the integer value (ascending).

Architecture overview:
- Backend: FastAPI-based REST API with a WebSocket endpoint for demo interaction.
- Frontend: Lightweight static page (HTML/JS) to demonstrate REST interaction (and a WebSocket hook).

Contributions are welcome. See the References section for OSS resources used.
